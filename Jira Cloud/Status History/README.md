# Status History App

This app allows you to see the status history of a set of tickets. The status of each ticket
is shown in a status chip for each date. Comments on tickets are grouped by date and treated
as "annotations" for those dates. Hovering on a status chip will show the annotations.
Clicking on a status chip will open a dialog where you can add an annotation for that date.
New annotations will be logged as new comments on the ticket but with a "for-date" tag that
indicates which date the annotation was for.
